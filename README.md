*Information*

Currently, I am a MSBA student at the University of Iowa Tippie College of Business. At the University, I was able to use my leadership and initiative skills to start the first Iowa Pickleball Club. On the other hand, I used my analytical skills in a group project to determine independent factors that had a significant impact on the price of one unit of an Airbnb in Chicago. Lastly, I was able to use my achieving attitude to set the goal of graduating one year early which I will accomplish in May 2021 with my bachelors and then my masters in May 2022.
